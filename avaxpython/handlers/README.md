# avax-python Handlers

Handlers allow you to make your avaxpython node adapt to custom applications.

avaxpython.handlers are meant to centralize the customization of avaxpython behavior.

By implementing your own network and consensus handlers you are able to intercept all Avalanche messages and process them as required.
